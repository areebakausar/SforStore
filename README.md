# SforStore


This repository contains Code for the ecommerce store "SforStore". This code was built upon boiler plates with help of Youtube and Udemy tutorials alongwith several other online resources. This project was built during my efforts to learn MERN Stack. It utilizes React, React Hooks, MangoDB, Express Server, APIs and various Node packages for JWTAuthorization, middleware etc.
